# Easy Diet - COMP5216 Mobile Computing
**University of Sydney**

*Semester 2, 2018*

## Description
We embrace the philosophy of simplicity and strive for developing a concise and user-friendly mobile application that aims to promote usersâ€™ dietary adherence to diet plans. Instead of providing recipes, we simply recommend ready-to-eat food available in supermarkets and/or grocery stores so that the tediousness of cooking is avoided. In addition, we display a short list of recommended products for the users.
